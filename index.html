<p>Hi cute Greek girl, I can't ask you out for Valentine's day and I can't spend it with you but I wanted to atleast do something for you alot of different
  reasons. So i'm making an online letter to you.</p>
  I know you want me to not say all the things I like about you so i'll keep it short (also you've got too much of an ego already)
  <ul> 
    <li> You're cute as hell (especially when you smile) </li>
  <li> Your accent is god damn AMAZING </li>
    <li> I get butterflies in my stomach whenever you get mad :D </li>
    <li> Out of everyone i've met, i've never met someone who's made me feel so valueable and you've had far less chances to do something
    like that than most people</li>
